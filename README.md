# Sem-8-final-project
# This is my final year project 
# Here my aim is to make a model that will work on the principle of volume divergence
# The aim of the model will be to predict the next high or low
# Volume Divergence is a basic but effective way to know the intrest of the investors
# Their are four thing to keep in mind 
# 1. Positive conformend divergence
# 2. Negative conformend divergence
# 3. Negative fake divergence
# 4. Positive fake divergence
